# MIT_BIH_ECGs
Step 1: In this study, the ECG time-series signal in the MIT-BIH dataset is divided into t1 before point R and t2 after point R, where t1 has 90 nodes and t2 has 166 nodes. The segmented ECG signal was filtered and denoised using AEs. AEs can improve the quality of the signal and reduce noise.
